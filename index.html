<h3>Background:</h3>
<p>This is an object oriented version of Micro Lisp. The language is very dynamic, easy to learn and fun. I am a Software Engineering student at the Technion, Israel. This project was done at the summer of 2015.</p>

<h3>Micro Lisp Style:</h3>
<p>Both languages share the same base values, which are: positive integers, strings, true, false and cons (tuple of two other base values).</p><p>Most expressions are in the form of (&lt;function_name&gt; [&lt;arguments, seperated by &#39; &#39;&gt;]) - in parentheses, and the function comes before the arguments (if any). <a href="http://webcourse.cs.technion.ac.il/234319/Spring2015/ho/WCFiles/_article-3-+-values-and-types.pdf" target="_blank">See more</a></p>

<h3>What is in the files:</h3>
<p>* mainloop: contains the main function, which has the main game loop that waits for input, translate and process it and show the result on screen (or error).</p>
<p>* system: has two main, important parts: the function responsible on the recursive execution of expression, and the implementation of the base functions.</p>
<p>* memmanage: deals with memory management. Supports allocation of cons, and the mark-sweep algorithm.</p>
<p>* bitarray: supplies us with bit array, makros supporters.</p>

<h3>Structure:</h3>
<p>The language implementation is built from three main parts: memory management (memmanage), expressions execution (system) and the interpreter. We will now cover the techniques used in each level of the language.</p>

<b>Memory Management:</b>
<p>All the systems components are represented as cons (see below), thus we support only cons and strings allocation and garbage collection. The cons and string handlers pools are 2^14  in size.</p>
